  title={NüshuRescue: Revitalization of the Endangered Nüshu Language with AI},
  author={Yang, Ivory and Ma, Weicheng and Vosoughi, Soroush},
  abstract={The preservation and revitalization of endangered and extinct languages is a meaningful endeavor, conserving cultural heritage while enriching fields like linguistics and anthropology. However, these languages are typically low-resource, making their reconstruction labor-intensive and costly. This challenge is exemplified by Nüshu, a rare script historically used by Yao women in China for self-expression within a patriarchal society. To address this challenge, we introduce NüshuRescue, an AI-driven framework designed to train large language models (LLMs) on endangered languages with minimal data. NüshuRescue automates evaluation and expands target corpora to accelerate linguistic revitalization. As a foundational component, we developed NCGold, a 500-sentence Nüshu-Chinese parallel corpus, the first publicly available dataset of its kind. Leveraging GPT-4-Turbo, with no prior exposure to Nüshu and only 35 short examples from NCGold, NüshuRescue achieved 48.69\% translation accuracy on 50 withheld sentences and generated NCSilver, a set of 98 newly translated modern Chinese sentences of varying lengths. A sample of both NCGold and NCSilver is included in the Supplementary Materials. Additionally, we developed FastText-based and Seq2Seq models to further support research on Nüshu. NüshuRescue provides a versatile and scalable tool for the revitalization of endangered languages, minimizing the need for extensive human input.},

  title={MentalManip: A Dataset For Fine-grained Analysis of Mental Manipulation in Conversations},
  author={Wang, Yuxin and Yang, Ivory and Hassanpour, Saeed and Vosoughi, Soroush},
  abstract={Mental manipulation, a significant form of abuse in interpersonal conversations, presents a challenge to identify due to its context-dependent and often subtle nature. The detection of manipulative language is essential for protecting potential victims, yet the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) currently faces a scarcity of resources and research on this topic. Our study addresses this gap by introducing a new dataset, named MentalManip, which consists of 4,000 annotated movie dialogues. This dataset enables a comprehensive analysis of mental manipulation, pinpointing both the techniques utilized for manipulation and the vulnerabilities targeted in victims. Our research further explores the effectiveness of leading-edge models in recognizing manipulative dialogue and its components through a series of experiments with various configurations. The results demonstrate that these models inadequately identify and categorize manipulative content. Attempts to improve their performance by fine-tuning with existing datasets on mental health and toxicity have not overcome these limitations. We anticipate that MentalManip will stimulate further research, leading to progress in both understanding and mitigating the impact of mental manipulation in conversations.},

  title={Enhanced Detection of Conversational Mental Manipulation Through Advanced Prompting Techniques},
  author={Yang, Ivory and Guo, Xiaobo and Xie, Sean and Vosoughi, Soroush},
  abstract={This study presents a comprehensive, long-term project to explore the effectiveness of various prompting techniques in detecting dialogical mental manipulation. We implement Chain-of-Thought prompting with Zero-Shot and Few-Shot settings on a binary mental manipulation detection task, building upon existing work conducted with Zero-Shot and Few- Shot prompting. Our primary objective is to decipher why certain prompting techniques display superior performance, so as to craft a novel framework tailored for detection of mental manipulation. Preliminary findings suggest that advanced prompting techniques may not be suitable for more complex models, if they are not trained through example-based learning.},
