Hello! I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at Dartmouth, where I am part of the Minds, Machines and Society lab led by Professor Soroush Vosoughi. My research focuses on Natural Language Processing and AI Alignment, particularly in the detection of persuasion and enhancement of LLM defenses against persuasion attempts.

In what feels like a different lifetime, I received my Bachelor’s of Business Administration and Bachelor’s of Science in Cognitive Science from the University of Michigan. I worked briefly in finance and start-ups in San Francisco, where I was inspired by the vibrant tech scene to take Computer Science courses at Harvard University and Stanford University. Eventually, I made the leap of faith to return to school.

Given my unconventional journey, I am always excited to connect with others with different perspectives. Do reach out if you would like to collaborate!
