Hello! I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at Dartmouth, where I am part of the Minds, Machines and Society lab led by Professor Soroush Vosoughi. My research focuses on Natural Language Processing and AI Alignment, particularly in the detection of persuasion and enhancing LLM defenses against persuasion attempts. I was also part of the Spring 2024 cohort for Supervised Program for Alignment Research (SPAR) organized by UC Berkeley, where I conducted work on activation steering vectors.

In what feels like a different lifetime, I received my Bachelor’s of Business Administration and Bachelor’s of Science in Cognitive Science from the University of Michigan. I worked briefly in finance and start-ups in San Francisco, where I was influenced by the vibrant and burgeoning tech culture. My professional network inspired me to start taking Computer Science courses for academic credit at both Harvard University and Stanford University, before I decisively made the leap of faith to return to school.

Given my rather unconventional foray into the research world, I am always excited to connect with others and hear from different perspectives. I also firmly believe in the power of collaboration to advance research and innovation, so feel free to reach out if you would like to collaborate!
