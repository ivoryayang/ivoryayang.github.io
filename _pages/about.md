Hello! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [Dartmouth](https://home.dartmouth.edu/), where I am part of the Minds, Machines and Society lab led by [Prof. Soroush Vosoughi](https://faculty-directory.dartmouth.edu/soroush-vosoughi). My research focuses on social applications of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, particularly on revitalization of endangered languages and persuasion / mental manipulation. I created the first digitized dataset and LLM-based learning framework for the endangered [Nüshu language](https://home.dartmouth.edu/news/2025/04/language-preservations-efforts-get-ai-boost), the world's only known writing system created and used exclusively by women.

In what feels like a different lifetime, I received my Bachelor’s of Business Administration and Bachelor’s of Science in Cognitive Science from the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). I worked briefly in finance and start-ups in San Francisco, where I was inspired by the vibrant tech scene to take Computer Science courses at [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu/) and [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/). Eventually, I made the leap of faith to formally return to school.

Given my unconventional journey, I am always excited to connect with others and listen to different perspectives. Feel free to reach out if you would like to collaborate!
