Hello! I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at [Dartmouth](https://home.dartmouth.edu/), where I am part of the [Minds, Machines and Society lab](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~soroush/) led by [Prof. Soroush Vosoughi](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/people/soroush-vosoughi/). My research focuses on Natural Language Processing and AI Alignment, particularly in the detection of persuasion and enhancement of LLM defenses against persuasive attempts.

In what feels like a different lifetime, I received my Bachelor’s of Business Administration and Bachelor’s of Science in Cognitive Science from the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). I worked briefly in finance and start-ups in San Francisco, where I was inspired by the vibrant tech scene to take Computer Science courses at [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu/) and [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/). Eventually, I made the leap of faith to formally return to school.

Given my unconventional journey, I am always excited to connect with others and listen to different perspectives. Feel free to reach out if you would like to collaborate!
